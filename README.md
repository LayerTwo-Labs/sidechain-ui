# Sidechain UI Template

ðŸš§ Under construction

This application is built using [Fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne)

Currently setup for Linux, but sould easily be able to add binaries for Mac/Windows as this framework is crossplatform

If you'd like to build from source check below.

## Development Enviornment Prerequisites

- [Golang 1.2+](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- [Fyne Prerequisites](https://developer.fyne.io/started/) <-- IMPORTANT depending on your environment there are some things you need

Once you've gotten your development environment setup

1. clone repo
2. change into directory and run

```
go mod tidy
go run .
```

Some things to note. You'll need to put the sidechain binary in the binaries folder.

Then use embed in the conf.go file.

You can see this already happening wth testchand.
